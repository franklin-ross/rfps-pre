## New

* Initial build containing a single room with one enemy.
* The player has fairly standard FPS controls: <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to move, <kbd>space</kbd> to jump, <kbd>1</kbd>/<kbd>2</kbd>... to equip weapons,
  <kbd>left-mouse</kbd> to attack while equipped.
* Both the player and enemy have health that is damaged when their opponent hits them, but neither
  can die. The player's health bar will deplete as they take damage though.
